- 👋 Hi, I’m @weronikapaluch, a student from Poland and a future computational linguist 
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring new cultures, travelling on a budget & literature 📚
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fundamental skills, to have a strong base for future endeavours 🚀🚀
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects big and small! Open to anything :) 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I recently learned of the **_knickerbocker glory_** ice cream sundae. It's such a **crazy** name.
  This was the topic of the recent, and **antepenultimate** (another word that I learned), episode of _Something Rhymes with Purple_. Susie Dent and Gyles Brandreth host it, and it's etymological gold🔥! Highly recommend.
